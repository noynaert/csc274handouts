The magnifying glass on the left side opens the Search and Replace window.

![Controls](Controls.png)|The controls may be highlighted. The .* symbol on the right allows you to use Regex for the search.  Th Aa button controls whether the search is case sensitive.  The *nix environment is simulated with both of these controls selected.  

One point of caution.  If you have a project (or a directory or folder) open, then the search goes across the entire project.  That can be very bad, if you are not watching carefully.m
