# 14.030 Distribution

This document is targeted at people installing Linux desktop for the first time.

I suggest that first-time (or even second-time) Linux users stay with Ubuntu or something that is derived from Linux.  More experienced users may wish to branch out.

Reasons for staying in the Ubuntu family:

* Almost all major software is released for Ubuntu.
* If you have a problem or need to know how to do something there is almost guaranteed to be documentation about how to do it in Ubuntu.

* If you have a decent system
  * [https://ubuntu.com/#download](https://ubuntu.com/#download) and pick "Ubuntu Desktop"
* If you have an underpowered system
  * [https://kubuntu.org/](https://kubuntu.org/) for a somewhat underpowered system
  * [https://lubuntu.me/](https://lubuntu.me/) if it is really a piece of junk or a small hard drive
* Mint is a good choice as well, especially if you really, really liked Windows XP and Windows 7.
  * [https://linuxmint.com/download.php](https://linuxmint.com/download.php)
    * Pick the Cinnamon desktop in most cases
    * Go with XFCE if you are running on a piece of junk or have a small hard drive
* Elementary OSis a good choice for Mac users if you have a powerful enough system.
  * There is a lot of eye-candy.  It trades performance for pretty.
  * Get it at [https://elementary.io/](https://elementary.io/)  They have free and unpaid versions, but you have to hunt for the free
  * I do like it for laptops because of the "Picture-in-Picture feature.  You can simulate it in other desktops, but PnP on Elementary does it right and out-of-the-box.
* I have to mention [Pop! OS](https://pop.system76.com/).  I recommend it for CS majors who want something taylored for developers.

## Debian Systems

Debian itself is a solid distribution

Debian systems install new software with a program called apt (or an older versions called apt-get and dpkg).  They are often called "deb" systems because the installation packages end with the extension ```.deb``` 

### Downstream from Ubuntu

Ubuntu is derived from Debian.  However, Ubuntu keeps its own repositories for software.  Therefore things may be available for pure Debian systems.
