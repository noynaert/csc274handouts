# 14.050 Physically Installing Linux

In most cases the procedure is the same.

1. Double check your system to make sure you have anything like pictures and documents stored safely somewhere else
1. Figure out the details of your hardware
    * Verify 4+cores and amount of RAM
    * Do you have an Nvidia video card?
2. Visit the distribution's website
   * Is there a distro that matches your hardware?
     * If you have Nvidia, do they have a special version?
   * Do they have a "Live" version you can test?
3. Download an .iso file
4. Check the signature on the file to make sure it is legitimate.  [Howto Geek has a good guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/67241/htg-explains-what-are-md5-sha-1-hashes-and-how-do-i-check-them/)
5. Find an old USB drive (4 gig is probably enough)
6. Burn the iso onto the USB drive
7. Test out the live CD if you can
8. Install the OS
   * Be very careful at disk partitioning, especially if you are doing dual boot
   * If you are not very experienced, I suggest you do install any proprietary or third-party drivers.
1. Look for a website thas has "things to do after installing <your distro>.  Ignore most of their 18 or 32 things; the author is propably just stating their personal preferences.  But *do* pay attention to how to update your system.  This should be done right away.  If you are a new user set up your system to do automatic updates.
2. Be aware that you may want to reinstall later.  I think most new users have a tendency to distro-hop for a while.  It's not necessarily a bad thing.
