# Unit 14.040 Desktop

## Gnome is the standard

    Task Bar is on the left.  
    
    Use the Windows key or the button in the lower left corner to bring up other apps

## KDE

Lightweight, has a lot of utilities

## Window Managers

I love Window Managers.  I am very fond of both DM and Regolith.  But new Linux users should probably stay away for now.
