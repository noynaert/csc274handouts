# Unit 07.010 Overview

Working into a scripting

* We need tools
  * vi editor
  * redirection options often used in scripting
* We need to know about things like the path and file permissions

* ```sed``` is like the ```tr``` command on steroids
* ```awk``` is like the ```cut``` command on steroids
