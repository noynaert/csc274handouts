# Unit 01.15 SSH (Optional)

If you are using Linux or a Mac you have a Bash shell already installed. It is probably accessed using your "terminal" command.

If you are on a Windows system you may use Putty or Bitvise. But if you have WSL or WSL2 installed on your Windows 10 system you may use the terminal and Bash shell in WSL.

Your password will be provided by your instructor

In the following example, the userid is _abyron_ but yours will be different

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Type the following into your console or terminal:

```bash
$ ssh abyron@woz.csmp.missouriwestern.edu
```

This is probably your first login to this computer so you will be prompted with a security warning. If you get the warning type "y" and hit enter. You should not get this warning again unless you log in from a different computer or use different software.

You should now be prompted for your user name.

You may be prompted for a password or you may be prompted to enter a password.

## When you are finished

Type "exit" at the prompt. This will close the connection.
