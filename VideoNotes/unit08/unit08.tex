\noindent \textbf{Warstory:}  CPU speed is measured in Hertz.  1 hertz is 1 beat per second.  CPU speeds used to be measured in MHz (Megahertz).  The MHz kept creeping up to 800 MHz, 900MHz, and eventually hit 1000MHz.  This gave advertisers a problem.  Consumers had been trained to think more MHz was good.  So consumer-oriented advertisements would advertise 1000MHz.  But if the computer was being marketed to techies, the same system would be marketed as 1 GHz.  Eventually consumers figured out that they really wanted to have one of those "Gigahertz things" on their computer.  
\question One day a student brought in a new advertisement for an old computer.  It was a very low price on a computer with one of those "Gigahertz things."  The add said that the CPU was .8 GHz.   What was the speed of this computer in MHz?
