# 15.020 Python for regular stuff

There are a lot of Bash scripts that do things that are not really OS related.  

The homework we did with bitcoin file is an example of that.

I wrote a script to find the average in Bash

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash
echo "Starting"
FILE="/var/www/html/bitcoin.txt"
#FILE="bc.txt"
COUNT=0
SUM=0
LAST=""
while read line
do
   COUNT=$(($COUNT+1))
   #echo "The count is $COUNT"
   #echo "$line" | jq .rate
   RATE=$( echo "$line" | jq .rate )
   RATE=$(cut -d'.' -f1 <<< $RATE)
   SUM=$(( $SUM+$RATE ))

   DATE=$( echo "$line" | jq .time )
   if [[ $DATE > $LAST ]] ; then LAST=$DATE ; fi

   if [[ $(($COUNT % 100)) -eq 0 ]]
   then
      echo "$COUNT  The raw rate is $RATE and the sum is $SUM Last $LAST"
   fi
done < $FILE
AVERAGE=$(( $SUM / $COUNT ))
echo "The average is $AVERAGE"
echo "The latest date is $DATE"
echo "{\"average\" : $AVERAGE, \"last time\": $LAST}" | jq .
echo "Done"
```

The above is just generic IT processing.  Here is the Python equivalent.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import json

# Open the file
fileName = "/var/www/html/bitcoin.txt"
file = open(fileName,'r') # open file for reading
lines = file.readlines()  # read entire file into array of lines
file.close()

# setup
count = 0
sum = 0

# Process the lines
for line in lines:
  event = json.loads(line)
  rate = event["rate"]
  sum = sum + rate
  count = count+1
  if count%100 == 0:
      print ("Count: %d  sum: %s"% (count,sum))

print ("The average is %d"%(sum/count))
print("Done!")
```
