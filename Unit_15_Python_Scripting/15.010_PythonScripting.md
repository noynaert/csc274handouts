# 15.010 Python Scripting

Bash scripting has a lot of problems.  Bash is a command interpreter.  It has a lot of problems as a scripting language for anything beyond trivial tasks.

## Problems with Bash as a Scripting Language

* The syntax is arcane and non-intuitive
* The subtle syntax rules makes scripting error prone
* It is slow.  Painfully slow
* No modularity
* Limited data types
* It is not portable
* Unit testing is almost impossible.
  
## Python

Python has become a *Lingua Franca* of IT.  Most people have at least some familiarity with it

Most non-trivial bash scripts can be written in Python.  It takes advantage of Python's speed, syntax, data types, and tools like unit testing.

## Setting up Python as a script

The command `which python` command shows that woz has python at /usr/bin/python

We can create python scripts just like bash scripts.  We just need to change the "sh-bang" on the first line.  Then we write regular Python 

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

print("Hello, World!")
```
