## Problems of Bash Scripts

Bash scripts are useful for very small tasks.  But they are prone to a lot of odd syntax traps and side effects.  Also, they tend to be very inefficient.  There are a lot of different command styles that lead to programmer confusion. Bash is also deficient in things like date processing, reading JSON and other configuration files, and difficulties in unit testing.

## Python

Python resolves a lot of the problems of Bash scripts.  It has a more coherent syntax.  It can also draw on vast libraries to cover specialized topics like date processing, processing JSON, Yaml, XML, and other files types.  It also posses AI and can implement unit tests.

Python is also faster, and most IDEs have utilities that will catch a lot of potential problems.
